Welcome to the classic word-guessing game of Hangman! Prepare to put your vocabulary skills to the test as you attempt to unravel the mystery word letter by letter. With each incorrect guess, a piece of the hangman's gallows is added, bringing you one step closer to his impending fate. But with wit and strategy, you can outsmart the gallows and reveal the hidden word before it's too late. Are you ready to accept the challenge and become the master of words? Let the guessing begin!

## Project Goals

A hangman game, aside from providing entertainment and enjoyment, serves as an exercise to stimulate logical thinking, creativity, and vocabulary development. It's a great way to practice deduction skills and strategy while having fun trying to guess words and phrases. Additionally, the hangman game can also be used as an educational tool, especially in learning environments, to teach spelling, vocabulary, and reinforce recognition of linguistic patterns.

## Flowchart

I have create a flowchart to offer me visual representation of the processes I would like to implement in the project. It helped me to break down complex problems into smaller, allowing for a systematic approach.
